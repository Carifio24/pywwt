This branch of the pyWWT repository hosts data files needed by the pywwt 
package, including footprints and dimensions of instruments and the JavaScript 
files that link the package to the web client. The K2 campaign is the only 
footprint we host at the moment, so if you can point us to files for other sky 
surveys, please let us know and we'll include them here.
