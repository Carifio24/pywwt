Documentation for pywwt
=======================

About
-----

.. warning:: this package is under heavy development and is not ready for
             general use. It will replace, once released, the existing `pywwt
             <http://github.com/jzuhone/pywwt>`_ package. The new package will
             include both a way to drive the web version of WWT, and the Windows
             version (using, for the latter, code from the original pywwt
             package).

The pywwt package aims to make it easy to use WorldWideTelescope from Python,
including from the Jupyter notebook. Only a very small subset of functionality
is implemented for now, and we will be adding functionality over the coming
weeks.
