Documentation for pywwt
=======================

About
-----

The pywwt package aims to make it easy to use WorldWideTelescope from Python,
and includes the following:

* A Jupyter notebook/lab widget
* A standalone Qt viewer/widget
* A client for the Windows version of WorldWide Telescope

Only a small subset of functionality is implemented for now, and we will be
adding functionality over the coming weeks.
