Modifying WorldWide Telescope settings
======================================

Visual settings
---------------

.. here we should describe the settings accessible via traits, e.g.
.. whether or not to show constellations, etc. We don't need to list them
.. exhaustively, just show a few examples.

Foreground/background layers
-----------------------------

.. We can have a dedicated section to show how to set the foreground/background
.. and how to list available layers. Also we can show how to load a new
.. image collection URL

Centering on coordinates
------------------------

.. here we need to demonstrate how to use center_on_coordinates
