Keyboard shortcuts
==================

In both widgets, viewer navigation with the mouse follows typical conventions --
click and drag up or down to move vertically; click and drag left or right to
move horizontally; mouse wheel or pinch/two-finger scroll on a touchpad to zoom.

In the Qt widget, it is also possible to navigate the viewer via keyboard
shortcuts that are further explained below.  

Basic movements
---------------

Imagining that the viewer's movements correspond with `an aircraft's principal
axes of rotation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes>`_, you
can perform two of the basic movements with the arrow keys alone:

``up``, ``down``: pitch
``left``, ``right``: yaw

To zoom, use:

``z``: zoom in
``x``: zoom out

Modified movements
------------------

``alt`` allows you to access the third axis of rotation:
``alt`` + ``left``, ``alt`` + ``right``: roll

In individual planet modes, ``alt`` + ``up`` or ``down`` tilts the body
vertically.

Finally, adding ``shift`` to any of the above keys or combinations acts as a
fine adjustment switch, performing the original action more slowly. For example,
``shift`` + ``z`` zooms in at a slower pace, and ``shift`` + ``alt`` + ``left``
gives you a slower roll motion.
